The problem is that the current situation of projecting objects, such as polygons and lines, on a map is hurting the performance of a GIS. The present systems only decide wether an object gets shown or not, without any intermediate steps. The problem can be solved by applying ‘the best’ simplification algorithm to an object to decrease the number of data points(coordinates) within an object. The best simplification algorithm will be determined by the data size reduction, the process time of the algorithm and the retainment of the visual representation of an object. A machine learning model will be develop and trained to decide which simplification algorithm fits an individual object the best. The machine learning model will be implemented in (a part of) the GIS and will be tested on performance with the present GIS.
